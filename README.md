# What is this

Reimplementation of the paper [A0C: Alpha Zero in Continuous Action Space](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.09613.pdf) in PyTorch.

The code of this implementation is based on the single player AlphaZero repo of the author https://tmoer.github.io/AlphaZero/.

## TODOS
- [ ] Verify that this works with tensorflow (in a virtualenv).
- [ ] Port models to PyTorch and test.
- [ ] Implement A0C.
- [ ] Use Pendulum to test (might need some custom wrappers).
